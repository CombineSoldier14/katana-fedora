# katana-fedora
RPM Packages for the Katana Desktop Enviornment for use on Fedora Linux.

I do not own KDE, [fluxer](https://github.com/fluxer) does. I made these packages for easy installation on Fedora.

These packages are taken from the *latest releases on the releases page* of katana and katie.

RPMs:
* katie
* kdelibs
* ariya-icons
* kde-l10n
* kde-workspace

(packages currently not done yet)
